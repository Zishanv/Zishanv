### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science and Machine Learning at the University of Calgary
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with businesses or organizations that are seeking to convert their data into meaningful insights that can improve how the business or organization operates
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can send a personal email to zishanvisram@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the average data scientist spends 80% of their time cleaning and preprocessing data, and the other 20% complaining about cleaning and preprocessing data? Jokes aside, data cleaning is a crucial but often tedious and time-consuming step in the data science process.
